- ORB SMASHER - Hit the orbs when they exceed 3/4 capacity - they will glow cyan.
- NUMBER BLOCKS - Choose pairs of blocks and combine them with the provided operations to reach the target number (all blocks must be used). All intermediate and final results must be nonnegative integers.
- SHAPE SHIFTER - Press keys in response to shapes appearing intermittently. Left arrow for square and right arrow for circle. The expected key is dependent on the shape and not location of the appearing entity.
- BALLOON - Press fill to increase the weight. The round ends when you take or when the weight exceeds some hidden (randomly generated) capacity. You win the filled weight if you take before the weight exceeds capacity. Capacity is normally distributed. The distribution is the same for each round in a game however changes across games.
- CODE COMPARE - Match the code at the top with the options below.
- PINCODE - Given the expected string, input either (the expected string, the expected string in reverse, the expected string except with sorted chars) in the input.
- THE SWITCH - Answer each prompt. The prompt refers to one of the two given data.
- MASTERMIND - Find the hidden number. Each attempt you will be shown the number of slots which hold correct digits.
- TOWERS - Rearrange the blocks to create the correct permutation. Only the topmost block of each stack can be moved.
